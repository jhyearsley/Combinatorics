    "## 1.2.6 The Quotient Principle\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.34\n",
    "##### (a) What is it that is different between the number of ways to stack ice cream in a triple decker cone with three different flavors of ice cream and the number of ways to simply choose three different flavors of ice cream?\n",
    "The difference arises from the ordering present in the triple decker cone. When simply choosing three different flavors, one ends up with an object that has no dependence on order, e.g. picking strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate is the same as picking vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. But when picking those three flavors for an ice cream cone, there is a first, second, and third scoop, hence chocolate first is distinct from chocolate second.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (b) In particular, how many different triple decker cones use vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry?\n",
    "There are $3!=6$ different triple decker cones using vanilla, chocolate and strawberry; $3$ choices for the first scoop, $2$ choices for the second scoop, and $1$ choice for the third scoop.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (c) Using your answer from part 34b, compute the number of ways to choose three different flavors of ice cream (out of twelve flavors) from the number of ways to choose a triple decker cone with three different flavors (out of twelve flavors).\n",
    "With the particular language we are using the number of ways to choose three different flavors of ice cream from $12$ particular flavors is equal to \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\# \\text{ of ways to stack ice cream in a triple decker cone choosing from 12 flavors}}{\\# \\text{ of different triple decker cones using three particular flavors}} = \\frac{12\\cdot 11 \\cdot 10}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.35 Based on what you observed in Problem 34c, how many $k$-element subsets does an $n$-element set have?\n",
    "An $n$-element set has \n",
    "$$\\frac{n^{\\underline{k}}}{k!} = \\frac{(n-k+1)!}{k!}$$\n",
    "total subsets. In other words\n",
    "$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{(n-k+1)!}{k!} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.36 Find a bijection that proves that $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$.\n",
    "Let $A$ denote the set of $k$-element permutations of $[n]=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,n\\}$ and $B$ denote the set of $(n-k)$-element permutations of $[n]$. The bijection is\n",
    "$$f : A\\to B, \\ x\\mapsto [n]\\setminus x.$$\n",
    "Verbally, this function can be described as mapping a $k$-element permutation $x$ to a $(n-k)$-element permutation $f(x)$ that contains the elements of $[n]$ that are not in $x$. So for example if $x=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,k\\}$ then $f(x)=\\{k+1,k+2,\\cdots,n\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.37 In how many ways can we pass out $k$ (identical) ping-pong balls to $n$ children if each child may get at most one?\n",
    "We assume $k\\leq n$ and the answer is $\\binom{n}{k}$. Since the ping-pong balls are identical they can not be distinguished so we cannot assign an ordering to them. In other words it doesn't make sense to label the ping-pong balls since once they are passed out we do have no way of knowing which ball is which.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.38 In how many ways may $n$ people sit around a round table? (Assume that when people are sitting around a round table, all that really matters is who is to each personâ€™s right.)\n",
    "Lets look at the case $n=3$ to get a feel for the problem. When $n=3$ we have the following arrangements\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(1,2,3)&=(2,3,1)=(3,1,2) \\\\\n",
    "(1,3,2)&=(2,1,3)=(3,2,1).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note the equivalences of certain arrangements due to the fact that the table is circular. This makes it so that there will be $(n-1)!$ total seating arrangements. Why? This is because the first person we select can have $n-1$ different people to the right, person 2 can have $n-2$ different, continuing on until person $n-1$ has only one person to sit to their right. In total this gives\n",
    "$$(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(1) = (n-1)!$$\n",
    "arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about this problem is that we can fix one person at the table, and then permute the remaining $n-1)$ people, which again gives $(n-1)!$ arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.39 The questions that follow are about the corresponding partition of the set of $k$-element permutations of an $n$-element set $S$, where $S$ and $k$ are arbitrary.\n",
    "##### (a) How many permutations are there in a block?\n",
    "The are $k!$ permutation in each block since each block consists of set of $k$ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (b) Since $S$ has $n$ elements, what does Problem 20 tell you about the total number of $k$-element permutations of $S$?\n",
    "The number of $k$-element permutations of $S$ is given by $n^{\\underline{k}} = n(n-1)\\cdot(n-k+1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (c) Describe a bijection between the set of blocks of the partition and the set of $k$-element subsets of $S$.\n",
    "A block contains all permutations of a $k$-element list, but each permutation of a $k$-element set yields only $1$ unique set. Thus, we map each set of blocks to its corresponding $k$-element subset of $S$, since each block contains only one set. This is a bijection since there are the same number of blocks of the partition as there are $k$-element subsets of $S$. Since these are finite sets with the same cardinality we are guaranteed that there is a bijection between them. So for instance if we have the block $\\{(1,2),(2,1)\\}$ it would be mapped to $\\{\\{1,2\\}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (d) What formula does this give you for the number $\\binom{n}{k}$ of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set?\n",
    "The same formula as before! It says that $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n^{\\underline{k}}}{k!}$, or in words the number of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set is equal to the number of $k$ element permutations of an $n$-element set divided by the number of length $k$ permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.40 A basketball team has $12$ players. However, only $5$ players play at any given time during a game.\n",
    "##### (a) In how many ways may the coach choose the $5$ players?\n",
    "There are $\\binom{12}{5}$ ways to pick the players.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (b) To be more realistic, the five players playing a game normally consist of two guards, two forwards, and one center. If there are five guards, four forwards, and three centers on the team, in how many ways can the coach choose two guards, two forwards, and one center?\n",
    "There are $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to pick the guards, $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to pick the forwards and $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to pick the center. In total this gives\n",
    "$$\\binom{5}{2}\\cdot \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot \\binom{3}{1}$$\n",
    "ways to pick the five players.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (c) What if one of the centers is equally skilled at playing forward?\n",
    "If one of the centers, say player $c$ can also play forward there are now $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to pick the forwards. But of the $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to pick the forward, player $c$ is in $4$ of these choices. If we are to choose player $c$ to play forward, he can no longer play center so we need to account for this in our counting. To do so we can partition the space of choosing the forwards and centers into one set where player $c$ is only conisdered a forward and the other set where player $c$ is only considered a center. Mathematically this means we have $\\binom{5}{2}\\cdot \\binom{2}{1}$ ways to choose the forwards and centers when player $c$ is considered a forward and $\\binom{4}{2}\\cdot\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose the forwards and centers when player $c$ is considered a center. In total this gives us\n",
    "$$\\binom{5}{2}\\cdot \\left(\\binom{5}{2}\\cdot \\binom{2}{1} + \\binom{4}{2}\\cdot \\binom{3}{1}\\right)$$\n",
    "ways to choose the five players.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.41 In Problem 38, describe a way to partition the $n$-element permutations of the $n$ people into blocks so that there is a bijection between the set of blocks of the partition and the set of arrangements of the $n$ people around a round table.\n",
    "We partition the $n$-element permutations into $(n-1)!$ blocks. To generate the blocks, first we write down the list $(1,2,\\cdots,n)$ and fix the element $1$. We then proceed to permute the indices of the elements $2$ through $n$. There are $(n-1)!$ ways to permute these indices hence we end up with $(n-1)!$ different lists and each list is added to a block. Next we fill out each block by performing $n$ shifts on the indices of the unique list in each block. Each of the $n$ shift entails shifting every index $i$ ($i=1,\\cdots, n$) such that each index increases by $1$ except for the $n^{th}$ index which is set to $1$. After the $n$ shifts we arrive at the original list first added to each block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have generated the blocks the bijection is simple to express. We map each block to the unique arrangement that it represents in the $(n-1)!$ possible arrangements. So for instance in the case of $n=3$ we have the following bijection:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\{(1,2,3),\\{3,1,2\\},\\{2,3,1\\}\\} &\\mapsto \\{(1,2,3)\\} \\\\\n",
    "\\{(1,3,2),\\{2,1,3\\},\\{3,2,1\\}\\} &\\mapsto \\{(1,3,2)\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.6.43 In how many ways may we string $n$ distinct beads on a necklace without a clasp?\n",
    "This problem is equivalent to seating $n$ people around a round table since we can just create a one-to-one correspondence between each distinct bead and each person. Thus we have $(n-1)!$ ways in total. "
