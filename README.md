# Combinatorics
This repo is a place to maintain and document my progress in solving
some c ombinatorics problems taken from the textbook *Combinatorics Through
Guided Discovery* by Kenneth P. Bogart. The text can be found online for free
[here](https://math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/electronic/kpbogart/ComboNoteswHints11-06-04.pdf).

Contains solved solutions as well as some occasional
python code to visualize the solutions themselves. Notebooks are not 
guaranteed to be fully finished and should be considered as works in progress.

In general I will not give in-depth solutions to all of the problems
that I solve, however for those problems that take me a significant amount
of time to solve, I will attempt to write up my thought process and a 
thorough explanation.
